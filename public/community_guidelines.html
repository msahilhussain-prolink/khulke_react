            <article class="my-4 px-1">
              1. Use Khul Ke for legal and acceptable purposes: Please don’t use Khul Ke for anything illegal, obscene, or defamatory. You also shouldn’t use it to impersonate someone else, send illegal messages, or use it for any non-personal use unless we’ve given you permission.
            </article>

            <article class="my-4 px-1">
              2. Keep it clean: Please don’t share any explicit or violent content. We want everyone to feel comfortable, so please make sure your posts and comments are appropriate for all ages.
